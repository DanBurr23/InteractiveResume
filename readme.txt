readme file

I got the tree structure javascript that I used for my roadmap from http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/8375092. 

I'm not sure if I correctly appended it to the section of html 
I created in index.html

I modified helper.js to account for multiple locations for one job, 
since I worked in multiple cities for one of the companies I worked for. 

I modified the style.css a little bit, but not too much. My thinking
was that a resume shouldn't be overly "busy", so I liked the simple
layout that was included with the basic project.
